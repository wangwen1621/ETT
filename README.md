ETT This is the ETT version we proposed in the following paper:Monte-Carlo-Assisted Endo-Exo Temporal Transformer for High-Confidence Interval Forecasting of Daily Runoff。 The paper is currently being published and a link will be provided later. Thank you for your interest in our work. I will release more elegant code in future versions. The main. py code contains various parts of the ETT model. Please refer to the introduction of the relevant paper for detailed information.
